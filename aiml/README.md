pip3 install aiml

then run:  python3.6 run.py. This command will start the chatbot.

Now, the knowledge of chatbot is limited, only for display use. We will impart more knowledge into our chatbot later to achieve the target of the project.


Run:

If you input Hello, hi, hi there, howdy and hola, the chatbot will give you a same answer: hi there!

If you ask How are you feeling today, the chatbot will response as what has been stored. In this example, state=happy has been

stored, therefore it will response: I am happy!

The chatbot will also store knowledge automatically, if you input "my dogs name is Mars", it will response "That is interesting that you have a dog named Mars".  Later, if you ask "what is my dogs name", it will give you the answer: "Mars".
