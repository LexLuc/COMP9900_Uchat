        <template>You should give the lecturer five (5) working days to respond to your email, if the lecturer has not replied after these days then you may send them a reminder email.

        <pattern>* CHANGE * PROGRAM*</pattern>
        <template>If you are an undergraduate student currently studying at UNSW then you may apply for a program transfer via the two following methods:
            
            Internal Program Transfer (IPT) via myUNSW; or
            University Admission Centre (UAC) [only available to domestic students]
            For more information on the difference between IPT via myUNSW and UAC you should check the Faculty of Engineering website.
            
            If you are a postgraduate student please ensure you meet the requirements listed on the Faculty Enrolment Rules website. You can then submit a Postgraduate Internal Program Transfer request form.
            
            Your application will be assessed after release of results for the current semester.

        <template>Selecting your courses for the coming semester can be challenging. A good starting point is to consult the program structure outlined on our website here.
            
            Once you know the core courses and/or electives you want to enrol in, you can consult the UNSW Handbook for course descriptions, and the UNSW Timetable to determine availability and class times.
            
            Students should also check the UNSW Computing Enrolment Advice page.

            You will not be financially liable for the course.
            The course will not appear on your transcript.
            The course will not be included in the calculation of your Weighted Average Mark (WAM).
            The course will not be included in the calculation of your academic standing.
            The Census date for Semester 1 is 31st March
            
            The Census date for Semester 2 is 31st August
            
            The Census date for Summer Semester is 8th January
            
            Please see this link(https://student.unsw.edu.au/enrolment-drop-course) for instructions on how to drop your course.

        <template>Unfortunately, if you have failed a course that is a pre-requisite to your enrolment next semester, there is a high chance you will be removed from your enrolment in those courses.
            
            We would encourage you to adjust your enrolment for Semester 2 now that results have been released and, if you have failed a core course, enrol into this course again.
            
            For example, if you have failed COMP1511 and have already enrolled in COMP1521/COMP1531/COMP2521, you will be removed from these courses. If COMP1511 is core to your program, we recommend that you enrol in this course again.

            To swap into an available course or change tute/classes for an enrolled course, you can follow the step-by-step instructions available on the following Enrolment web page(https://student.unsw.edu.au/update-enrolment-guide).

If a course is not cancelled on the Class Timetable then we anticipate that the course is running, however, the deadline for the School to cancel a course is not until 1 week before semester commences.
            
            Cancellations that close to the start of semester are rare.

Note that myUNSW is the most up-to-date list of enrolments. There is generally a lot of enrolment movement around Week 1 of each Semester. Unfortunately, we do not over-enrol CSE courses and there is no waiting list.</template>

        <template>Waivers are generally not approved for core courses or in cases where the requisite is a core course in your program or in the case of postgraduate students where transfer credit or exemption is available. Please visit the CSE Requisite Waiver Policy page for more details.
            If the requisite is not a core course and you'd like it to be waived to enrol in an Elective, requisite waivers may be considered on the basis of the following:
            Requisite course was completed on exchange or cross-institutional study
            - Must provide academic transcript
            
            Requisite course was completed in prior studies and no transfer credit was granted
            - Must provide academic transcript + course outlines
            
            Requisite course knowledge was gained through other experience (e.g. work experience)
            - Must provide supporting documentation (e.g. resume)
            
            Before submitting your requisite waiver please consult the Faculty Enrolment Rules and the Lecturer in Charge.
            
            If the Lecturer supports your request, please submit a Requisite Waiver request form.</template>

        <template>Managing your enrolment is your responsibility. You must be correctly enrolled in your courses by the enrolment deadline each semester. The deadline for adding courses is the end of the first week of the teaching period in which the course is offered. Adding courses after enrolments have closed is not normally permitted as it is required that students attend no less than 80% of classes.
            
            If, due to exceptional circumstances, you need to request late enrolment for a course, you may be charged a late enrolment fee of $250. It is important that you familiarise yourself with the Late Enrolment Changes policy and also the enrolment deadlines, which can be found on the Key Dates website.
            
            For all late enrolment requests please ensure you meet the requirements listed on the Faculty Enrolment Rules website. You should also discuss your late enrolment request with the Lecturer in Charge. If the Lecturer supports your request, please submit the late enrolment request to the CSE Student Office by email.
            
            Please include; your student ID number, lecturer’s support, reason for the request and the class you wish to be enrolled in. Your request will then be considered and you will be notified of the outcome via email.

        <template>The CSE student office does not generally permit substitution requests as core courses are necessary towards accreditation.
            
            Please review the Faculty Enrolment Rules regarding substitutions.
            
            If you meet the requirements, you may submit a Course Substitution request form.
            
            Your application will be reviewed and you will receive a response to your student email. Please allow up to 3-4 weeks for processing.
