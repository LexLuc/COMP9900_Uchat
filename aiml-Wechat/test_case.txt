If you have enrolled in the web lecture then this will not be listed in your Class Timetable as there will be no room allocated to this lecture.

You are required to listen to the lecture recordings in your own time and place.


Input:what should I do if I miss the enrolment deadline
Managing your enrolment is your responsibility. You must be correctly enrolled in your courses by the enrolment deadline each semester. The deadline for adding courses is the end of the first week of the teaching period in which the course is offered. Adding courses after enrolments have closed is not normally permitted as it is required that students attend no less than 80% of classes. If, due to exceptional circumstances, you need to request late enrolment for a course, you may be charged a late enrolment fee of $250. It is important that you familiarise yourself with the Late Enrolment Changes policy and also the enrolment deadlines, which can be found on the Key Dates website. For all late enrolment requests please ensure you meet the requirements listed on the Faculty Enrolment Rules website. You should also discuss your late enrolment request with the Lecturer in Charge. If the Lecturer supports your request, please submit the late enrolment request to the CSE Student Office by email. Please include; your student ID number, lecturerâs support, reason for the request and the class you wish to be enrolled in. Your request will then be considered and you will be notified of the outcome via email.
